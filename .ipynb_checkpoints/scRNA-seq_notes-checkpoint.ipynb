    "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a great tool to allow us to see at cellular resolution that you can't get using bulk RNA-seq which only measures average expression levels across all cells. scRNA-seq can estimate the distribution of expression levels across the cells in your sample making it ideal for studying heterogenous cell populations. It also has the advantage of sampling all transcripts in your sample in an unbiased way, unlike microarrays and RT-qPCR which are limited to a limited set of transcripts. This means that scRNA-seq is great for:\n",

    "- Studying cell differentiation during development\n",

    "Protocols usually follow these steps:\n",
    "1. Cells in a solid sample are dissociated\n",
    "2. (optional: cells can be selected for using markers, fluorescent transgenes or staining dyes)\n",
    "3. They are then isolated and captured. Three methods for this are:\n",
    "    - **Microtitre-plate-based methods** - cells are put in individual wells using things like pipetting, microdissection of fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS). This method allows you to take pictures of the cells so you can remove damage cells or wells that have more than one cell (known as doublets). FACS also lets you sort cells by things like cell size or intensity of labels and place them in specific wells to give you some more infomation for your downstream analysis. However, this method is work-intestive so is low-throughput.\n",
    "    - **Microfluidic-array-based methods** - these are efficient methods that combines cell capture with library preparation so is high-throughput. However, it only captures around 10% of cells so is not good for rare cell types or small samples. Also, the nanowells used are customised for particular sizes which can introduce some bias when studying tissues.\n",
    "    - **Microgluidic-droplet-based methods** - these are the most popular methods used today and have the highest through-put. Cells are trapped in an nanoliter-sized oil droplet with a bead. This bead has the things needed to make the library and a unique barcode that is attached to all reads from one cell. This means that sequencing can be done on all cells together.\n",
    "4. RNA is extracted\n",
    "5. Then it is reverse-transcribed into cDNA\n",
    "6. cDNA is then amplified (by *in vitro* transcription or PCR)\n",
    "7. This is then built into a sequencing library\n",
    "8. Sequencing using NGS\n",
    "9. An expression matrix can then be used for further analysis\n",

    "The protocol you choose to use will depend on study design and aims. If you want to find a rare cell populatation, you will want to sequence more cells (e.g. 10x Chromium), but if you want to study a particular known cell type, it may be better to sequence fewer cells at a higher resolution (e.g. using SMART-seq2). How many cells needed can be estimated here: https://satijalab.org/howmanycells/ and https://satijalab.org/costpercell/. As different protocols can have variations in accuracy and sensitivity (how much starting RNA is needed), you can also look at studies comparing different protocols: Ziegenhaln et al, 2017; Scensson et al, 2017, Ding et al, 2020."

Also, before aligning, cells should be checked to see if they have enough mappable reads (~60-70% - but it is important to compare with other cells in the sample and remove outliers).

It is able to find regions where the read spans more than one exon making it a 'splice aware' aligner.

CRAM files are similar to BAM files but are more compressed and can be converted to BAM files using samtools. \n",

    "**Pseudo-aligners e.g. Kallisto or Salmon** - these map k-mers, rather than reads, to a reference genome. K-mers are sequences of k length from a read. Psuedo-alignment is much faster than alignment and may be more robust to sequencing errors as it would only affect some, but not all, of the k-mers of a read. Kallisto, unlike traditional aligners, maps to a reference transcriptome, rather than a reference genome meaning they map to isoforms rather than genes. Traditional aligners would have to calculate abundances using maximum likelihood abundance estimated using the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm using tools like RSEM. Aligning to a transcriptome is difficult because:\n",

    "- **Tag-based** - these only capture either the 3' or 5' ends of the trancript. This is useful when combined with UMIs which is an improvement on the full-length method as the PCR amplification step can lead to unequal representation of transctipts. The UMI can be used to adjust the transcript count to get the true trancript abundance. Having said this, as the whole transcript is not used, it can be difficult to distinguish between different isoforms. The 10x Chromium protocol uses this method.\n",

You might assume that every unique UMI-transcript pair correlates to all reads from a sinlge RNA molcule, but this is not always true because:\n",

    "2. Mapping errors/multimapping reads - this means that some UMIs are assigned to the wrong gene/transcript, usually because the transcripts are very similar, resulting in an overestimation of transcripts. It can be mitigated by remocing UMIs with few reads that prove their association with a transcript or by removing all multi-mapping reads. Mire recently, a strategy of splitting read counts can be used e.g. if a read alligns to equally well to 3 paralogous genes, then each paralog gets 1/3 count.\n",
